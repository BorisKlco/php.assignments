# File Upload System
Task: Build a system that allows users to upload a file:

- Validate the file type (e.g., only allow images like .jpg, .png).
- Limit the file size (e.g., max 2MB).
- Save the file to a directory and store the file path in a database.
- Bonus: Generate a thumbnail version of uploaded images.
